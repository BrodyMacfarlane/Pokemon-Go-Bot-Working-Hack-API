# Pokemon Go Working Bot Hack
## USE WITH CAUTION! 
Niantic may ban you if you run the bot while signed in through your phone.
## Instructions
1. Download or fork project and open up zip file.
2. Open up CMD/Terminal and change directory to that folder; for example, if I saved it the file in my desktop, I would `cd Desktop` and then `cd Pokemon-Go-Bot-Working-Hack-API-master`
3. You need to install Python version 2.7 and have pip installed; if you don't have that, refer to tutorials on the web
4. Run the following line on terminal/CMD: `pip install -r requirements.txt` If that doesn't work then just add `sudo` to the beginning and enter the password for your main computer account.
5. Then go to the configure.json file and change whatever information you need. Then go to pokebot.py and change the latitude & longitude where stated in the comments.
6. Run the following line on terminal/CMD if you login into Pokemon Go with Google: `python pokebot.py -i 0` and `python pokebot.py -i 1` if you use Pokemon Trainer's Club
7. After you run it the first time add `--cache` to the end. For example, `python pokebot.py -i 0 --cache`
8. Many thanks to Tejado, Milaly, and the other wonderful devs that worked on this project!
